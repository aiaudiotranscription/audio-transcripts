 Work's which endure come from the soul of the people. The mighty in that pride walk along to destruction. The humble walk hand in hand with providence to immortality. Their work survives. When the people of the colonies were descending their liberties against the might of kings, they chose their banner from the design set in the firmament through all eternity. The flags of great empires of that day are gone, but the thousands types remain. It takes us a vision of the people whose eyes are turned to the rising dawn. It represents the hope of a father for his posterity. It was never planted for the glory of royalty, but to be born under it used to be the child of a king. And to establish a home under it used to be the founder of a royal health. Alone of all flags, it expresses the sovereignty of the people who can do us when all else passes away. Speaking with their voice, it has the sanctity of revelation. He who lives under it and disloyal to it is a traitor to the human rage everywhere. What could be saved is the flag of the American nation. Where to perish? America has many glories. The last one that she would wish to surrender is the glory of the man who have served her in war. While sex devotion lives, the nation is secure. Whatever dangers may threaten from within or without, she can view them calmly. Turning to her veterans, she can say, these are our defenders. They are invincible. In them, these are safe things. After more than five years of the bitterest war in human experience, the last great stronghold of force and ring of the demands of America and her allies agreed to cast aside the sword and live under the law. America decided that the path of the Mayflower should not be closed. She decided to sail the sea. She decided to sail, not under an edict of pot-slam, crimped in narrow lands, seeking safety and unarmed merchant men painted in fantastic hills as the badge of an infinite servitude. But she decided to sail under the ancient declaration of independence, using her arm-caused, maintaining security by the gums of her ships of the lion, flying at the mass, the stars and stripes, forever the emblem of a militant liberty. With ease has come past herity. Burden's have been great, but the strength to bear them has been greater. The condition of those who toil is higher, better, more secure than in all the ages' time. Out of the darkness of a great conflict has appeared the vision of a nearer, clearer, than ever before the life on earth and less under the deadening restraints of force, more and more under the vitalizing influence of reason. Marlpower has been clamping over physical power. Education will tend to bring reason and experience of the past into the solution of the problem of the future. We must look to service and not to help thisness by service as a foundation of progress. The greatest lesson that we have to learn is to speak ever the public welfare, to build up to maintain our American heritage.
